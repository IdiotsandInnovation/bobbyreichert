                                    Okay, I have a lot to say for this blog post. First of all, yesterday the FCC added DJI to their covered list, meaning DJI is no longer allowed to sell new drones or parts in the US. That means that DJI is now going to fully withdraw support from the US (if they haven't already) and I now have to go to Canada or China to get my drone serviced or to buy new parts. For the SAT, I got a 1430 (690 in ELA and 740 in math), which isn't very optimal, so I'll grind for the one on March 8th. I tried registering for the March 8th one, but every place in a 50 mile radius is fully booked, so I'm on a waitlist. I hope a spot opens up soon. It's Christmas Eve today, but I'm not really going anywhere. Also my R820T2 SDR broke so I can't receive any ADS-B signals, although I'm having someone bring another from China. For the movie, we watched School of Rock, which Vince surprisingly didn't choose, even though he seemed to be enjoying the scenes with naked men and the jokes about shoving sticks up others' asses. During the movie, Wayne ate seven bags of popcorn and he was throwing up all over the place. In our school there's two fatties: Wayne, who is too dumb to realize that he is full, and Viyan, who is never full. Also that day, the teachers had an arm wrestle and Janet won, then Lua, then Vince, then Scott. On Sunday, I found a 960 GB Sandisk SATA SSD, which is worth a couple hundred bucks, in a recycling pile. Also, I received a $100 Amazon gift card from my little brother's robotics team.

                                    On the SS computers presentation, I got a 28/30 because of Yi Keat. He stuck a non-MLA link in the citations page and that took two points off for us. This morning, I turned around and I just saw vince staring into my soul from inside the office. It was so creepy. Also, I'm working on adding a wiki page for whatever I might need it for. I's gonna come after 1.25 though. I don't think I've said this yet, but I will be implementing a login that is required in order to view this blog page. Also, there is a lot of flooding here with the atmospheric river. The temperatures have highs in the forties and fifties, and it's been raining nonstop for a week or so. Janet wasn't able to come to school today because of the flooding in North Bend. That means that we might not even be able to go the the North Bend Theatre next week if the floods persist. I can't believe it's already been a year since the last time we went there! It seems as if that was just a week ago. I remember Jayson, Brendan, and I sitting together in the back of the theatre watcching the movie, and then we had pizza afterward. It was so fun. Anyways, back to the weather, I don't know how those Californians can stand 80-degree weather in December. I can't even stand those temps in the summer. Also, I'm planning to make an NAS with one of my Raspberry Pis.

                                    Somehow today I cooked a hard drive. it was transferring data into it and then suddenly everything froze, and whenever I try to access the drive, it just freezes File Explorer until I unplug the drive. I opened it up and everything seemed fine. No scratches or stuff like that. According to Reddit, that means the drive is screwed. What a waste of a whole potential terabyte of storage. Luckily, I didn't have any important unrecoverable files in there. Tomorrow I have a presentation in Scott's about the history of computers.

                                    I don't think I did too well on the SAT. On the english section, I ran out of time so I guessed a couple of the questions. For the math section there were two problems that I was unsure about, including the last question of module 2, which I finished less than a second before the time ran out. So, my prediction for my score (comes out Dec. 19) is 630 on English, and 740 on math (1370 total).

First of all, the comma looks perfectly fine (at least to me), and second, he literally has the most illegible handwriting in the whole school (such a hypocrite). Also in social studies, I sit next two three sick people. I've started bringing a mask but I hope I don't get sick because I can't afford to be sick during the SAT (although I think I am starting to potentially feel some symptoms). It's also not just those three people. Half the people in the class (even Scott) are coughing like crazy. Worst of all is Yi Keat. He's clearly sick (he's coughing, got a stuffy nose, sore throat), and yet it seems like he doesn't even realize that he's sick. Plus, he keeps following me around and yapping into my face. He also sits next to me in social studies and he keeps trying to format this Powerpoint presentation before he even has his information down on the slide, and he talks into my face about it. Also, he claims that he doesn't have a cold and it's "just a sore throat". However, a sore throat is the most common symptom of a viral infection, and he's also sniffling his nose. I really hope I don't get sick. Also I fixed the blur effect on the mobile menu on the settings page. I'm working to expand the same menu to all the pages but I'll probaby do that after tomorrow.

                                    Welp ignore what I said last blog post about updating this website. Today I debugged the comments section on this page. Turns out, Google Firebase was configurated incorrectly. I took apart a couple of old PCs lying around in my house and disassembled the parts. Tomorrow I have a geometry test, and in the practice test, Anelia got a 56%. Also, the SAT is on Saturday, and on the last practice test, I got 1380 (score is out of 1600): 640 (out of 800) on english and 740 (out of 800) on math.

                                    Today was the first time in 165 days that Jayson, Brendan and I played a game of Gimkit. It was really fun and I hope we can do that more often. The trip to Victoria was interesting. The Canadians are quite creative with their signs. The second time I printed the case for my DVD drive, it worked. My first music playlist disc corrupted somehow, and I can read files from it, but not write new ones. So, I copied the files in the disc and burned them into a new one. I have paused this website's update 1.25 development until further notice (probably going to start again Dec. 7th or later).

I also decided to update the Settings page a bit. I am also making the <u><a href="test.html">test page</a></u> available to the public so you can test out new beta features the way I do.

She says that Pluto is the fifth planet in the solar system, turkeys are flightless birds, and the I in FBI stands for 'international'. Also, the CSS updates are now on the homepage. In Social Studies, Scott played Roar, Firework, California Girls (including the inappropriate parts) by Katy Perry and Wayne somehow knew the lyrics word for word. Part of the California Girls lyrics said 'sex on the beach', and the first thing Viyan thought of was that all the sand and insects are gonna get into their hole.

If you haven't noticed yet, the menu bar, scroll button, and cookie consent banner now all have a glass blur effect. So far, this is limited to the blog page, although I am working on getting it to all the pages. I am also still trying to figure out how to get Firestore working. Today's robotics competition was okay. Also, on Friday, Anelia said Rhode Island has the longest coastline, and when Sanvi was asked the same question, she asked, "What's a coastline?". She also said that the sun is a planet. Also today I broke the locking mechanism on my DVD drive somehow but the drive itself still works. I think I'll just 3D print a locking mechanism case to keep the drive shut.

I downloaded Bambu Studio on my Raspberry Pi. Also I now have proof theat Vince is making up the reading guide questions. Today at thew start of the class he accidentally had a Word document pulled up on the big screen and he was typing up the RG questions on the spot without even referencing notes or maybe a past RG. Also today Sanvi said that John Adams was the first US president and Republicans are eagles and Dems are pigs. She also says that Egypt fought in WWI and won. In the next major update to this website, I plan to make some UI changes so this site is less boring and bland.

                                    For some reason, when I ordered the 3D printer, it said that the backorder would take weeks to ship. But now, randomly, the 3D printer is now out for shipping. Bambulab also ships their packages in a pretty weird way. The order is split into five parts, and I have some packages shipping FedEx, some through UPS, and some through this thing called "Yun Express" or something. The printer is arriving on Friday, but I don't know when the filament or AMS will come. Also, I got an 100 on the skeleton parts quiz.

                                    Expect shorter and fewer blog posts from now on because I have officially gotten a spot to take the SAT on December 6th. So, I have to study really hard for the next couple of weeks (especially for the math section. The ELA section seems to be fairly easy). I also got a Bambulab P1S 3D printer with the AMS 2 Pro. The printer was on a $529 off discount (since the P2S just released and it's also almost Black Friday), and the filament that came with it totaled up to $98 in savings. However, the P1S is on backorder, so I don't know when it will actually ship. The AMS is already in transit though. Today in science there was a quiz on parts of the skeleton. I'm 95% sure I got an 100. Also, I have attempted to do some backend using Google Firebase, but it just refuses to work (hence the comments section below). I also rolled out update 1.24 over the weekend. Some pages still need a bit of formatting after 1.24.

I have tomorrow off, so I'm going to try to learn to use the CNC machine and update this website. I also just found out that my robotics team spent $200+ on lunch yesterday when we could've just spent $20. They also want to laser cut the metal drivetrain parts without CNCing wood for prototyping first. They're such money wasters, and half the parents don't even contribute money to the team. Tomorrow I'll also maybe call Jayson and Neel. Brendan still hasn't given me his Skype (now Teams, 🖕 Microsoft). I'll also CAD a v3 or v2+ robot and learn CAM.

                                    Lua gave more time during the test today, and I got an 100% on Big Ideas. I might have lost a couple of points on showing work, since my compass line was very faint. I got an 100% in the most recent (double-sided) reading guide. Wayne got 1.5 off on the second question but Vince was so lazy to calculate the score that he just gave Wayne a 10/10. In Scott's class, I have a summative assessment on Monday, which means I have a 90% chance of losing my 99 in Social Studies. It's on this book called Hiroshima by John Hersey. In science, we also have a short project and the due date is TBD. I've also completely made the switch to editing this site on VS Code on my RPi 4B. Cloudflare hosting is actually really good compared to W3spaces.

                                    In Geometry, there was a test that Lua said was "very short" but at the end of the period, half the people weren't done, and she says she probably will just have to grade what we have. So, half the class is extremely pissed at her (especially Julia, who was crashing out the rest of the day) and Wayne said he'll strangle her the next chance he gets. I'm really pissed too because I was part of the group that didn't finish. I really hope she gives extra time tomorrow. Also, we didn't have to play basketball today.

                                    I somehow destroyed my off-brand RPi Camera. While I was testing the camera feed, the camera ribbon came off and when I reconnected it, something shorted, but I still don't know what. Now the camera module doesn't work on either of my Pis. Also, today in English I got my grade back after Vince entered it wrong last week. In PE, Vince left to go take a s** session and some fentanyl, so Lyle was subbing and we played Capture the Flag. Tomorrow we have to play basketball because stupid Appoline wanted to. I hate Vince's "basketball" because its just a long game of bump where everyone shoots once, and then this stupid 'poison' thing. I think that Appoline likes it because she/he/they (I don't even know) can just sit on the side most of the period.

                                    Not much happened today. As usual, Vince took his biweekly absence, and gave us a DOUBLE-SIDED reading guide, while the second-period class gets to do IXLs. I think he took too much fentanyl the day before. Yesterday, I added a mobile-friendly menu, if you haven't noticed already, but I can't quite seem to get the settings page working. Brendan also finally won his first Gimkit game in about a week. By the way, yesterday was also Daylight Savings Day, which sucks because it messes up my sleep cycle and is essentially pointless. Plus, it just makes converting between time zones more difficult because some countries use DST and some don't. Also, yesterday I was on a call with Jayson and Neel, which was really fun. I wish that I could talk to them more often or even in person, but unfortunately thats impossible to do right now 😢.

                                    Today in English, we watched a Twilight Zone episode where an insane dude sees a weird labubu destroying a plane but only he can see it. The episode is called 'Nightmare at 20,000 Feet'. As a plane nerd, obviously I notice a couple of problems. First, it was filmed in a non-pressurized-type airframe, which can't fly at 20,000 ft. Second, the labubu person somehow didn't get flung off when he was standing vertical on a wing in the middle of a storm, and theres a few more that aren't as big. Also, when I went to raid peoples' candy, the Seattle weather completely soaked me. Also, I didn't have a costume so I just taped an image of Pete Hegseth on my face. (Note: I know this post says its October 31st, technically I'm writing this on November 1st because its 12:27 AM right now)

                                    Honestly, I'm not sure how my school is #1 in Washington state. First, it was that half the class didn't know which direction the sun rises. Then, Appoline and Anelia didn't know what a rhombus was, even though Lua warned them that a past student also didn't know the shape from the first-grade curriculum. Then, yesterday, Viyan didn't know the difference between beer, red wine and white wine. Rohit also asked if someone can be addicted to port wine (which is how Vince went on the ramble on addictions). Then today, Anelia said that you can only see the moon when it crosses in front of the sun. Olivia says the sun just appears because of the day and disappears at night. Also, Viyan doesn't know the definition of 'latter', and he keeps trying to steal my food. Also, if you have any new feature recommendations, please email me.

                                    Today in English, Vince yapped for so long about types of wine and wine addictions and drug addictions (he's such a hypocrite). Speaking of him, today he was a total of ten minutes late to class. In tennis baseball, I got three people out while I was at first base. Raymond also hit the ball straight up into the air nine times in a row and he kept getting foul balls. I decided to add a comments section to this page, but I then removed it shortly after because the Firestore dynamic content box wouldn't load. Also, if you haven't noticed already, I tweaked the format for this page a bit.

                                    I got around a 93% on the science test because I mixed up incomplete dominance and codominance. I also did a lot of editing to this website, which included adding two extra pages and a slight tweak in the menu UI. Mobile-friendly menus will come in the near future. I created an archive page for my blog posts over three months old so that this page doesn't get too cluttered, and I added a changelog/version history page with descriptions for each update. By the way, I have decided to not move this website back to w3spaces, so it should be here to stay until I decide otherwise. Also, I'm not dressing up for Halloween; I'm just gonna go raid peoples' candy. I've recently gotten an interest into optical disks (DVD, CD, Blu-ray, etc.), electro-mechanical disks (HDD), and similar disk-based storage methods. Also, in the lossless vs. lossy audio compression thing, I personally prefer lossy (mp3), since it is a much smaller file and there is no noticable difference between the compressed and uncompressed files. Additionally, mp3 is also the mainstream audio file compression format and is widely supported. Also, I have an SAT exam scheduled on December 6th, so I have to start practicing. For AP, testing doesn't happen until around May, so I have more time with that.

I'm also really busy this semester so I don't know when the next time I post will be. I'll make this website more mobile-friendly in the near future. I also have a science test on Monday and a reading guide with five questions due on Tuesday. My FTC team isn't doing too well and I still need to practice for ACSL, SATs, and USACO.
