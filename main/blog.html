                    Today was the first time in 165 days that Jayson, Brendan and I played a game of Gimkit. It was really fun and I hope we can do that more often. The trip to Victoria was interesting. The Canadians are quite creative with their signs. The second time I printed the case for my DVD drive, it worked. My first music playlist disc corrupted somehow, and I can read files from it, but not write new ones. So, I copied the files in the disc and burned them into a new one. I have paused this website's update 1.25 development until further notice (probably going to start again Dec. 7th or later).

                    I'm heading to Victoria, BC today. Yesterday I printed the first thing that I made myself in CAD. It was the bottom section for a case for my DVD drive. The measurements Dell gave me were wrong though, so I just wasted two hours of my time and a tenth of a spool of filament.

                    Today is the first day of Thanksgiving break! (unfortunately we don't get the entire week off like the Californians do) Today in Geometry, we were coloring in turkeys with markers. It was like one of those elementary school art projects. I also decided to update the Settings page a bit. I am also making the <u><a href=test.html">test page</a></u> available to the public so you can test out new beta features the way I do. The page may be extremely glitchy sometimes though.

                    The stupidity of Sanvi just never ends. She says that Pluto is the fifth planet in the solar system, turkeys are flightless birds, and the I in FBI stands for 'international'. Also, the CSS updates are now on the homepage. In Social Studies, Scott played Roar, Firework, California Girls (including the inappropriate parts) by Katy Perry and Wayne somehow knew the lyrics word for word. Part of the California Girls lyrics said 'sex on the beach', and the first thing Viyan thought of was that all the sand and insects are gonna get into their hole.

                    Today I updated the blog page CSS for update 1.25 testing. If you haven't noticed yet, the menu bar, scroll button, and cookie consent banner now all have a glass blur effect. So far, this is limited to the blog page, although I am working on getting it to all the pages. I am also still trying to figure out how to get Firestore working. Today's robotics competition was okay. Also, on Friday, Anelia said Rhode Island has the longest coastline, and when Sanvi was asked the same question, she asked, "What's a coastline?". She also said that the sun is a planet. Also today I broke the locking mechanism on my DVD drive somehow but the drive itself sill works. I think I'll just 3D print a locking mechanism case to keep the drive shut.

                    Welp the 3D printer arrived today. So far I still haven't made anything on Autodesk (con)Fusion, and have only been using files from Bambu Handy. I downloaded Bambu Studio on my Raspberry Pi. Also I now have proof theat Vince is making up the reading guide questions. Today at thew start of the class he accidentally had a Word document pulled up on the big screen and he was typing up the RG questions on the spot without even referencing notes or maybe a past RG. Also today Sanvi said that John Adams was the first US president and Republicans are eagles and Dems are pigs. She also says that Egypt fought in WWI and won. In the next major update to this website, I plan to make some UI changes so this site is less boring and bland.

I also now practice for the SAT during advisory. Also, today is exactly one year ago was the crazy bomb cyclone. Time flies. I also have another potential 8th-grade quote:

                    For some reason, when I ordered the 3D printer, it said that the backorder would take weeks to ship. But now, randomly, the 3D printer is now out for shipping. Bambulab also ships their packages in a pretty weird way. The order is split into five parts, and I have some packages shipping FedEx, some through UPS, and some through this thing called "Yun Express" or something. The printer is arriving on Friday, but I don't know when the filament or AMS will come. Also, I got an 100 on the skeleton parts quiz.

                    Expect shorter and fewer blog posts from now on because I have officially gotten a spot to take the SAT on December 6th. So, I have to study really hard for the next couple of weeks (especially for the math section. The ELA section seems to be fairly easy). I also got a Bambulab P1S 3D printer with the AMS 2 Pro. The printer was on a $529 off discount (since the P2S just released and it's also almost Black Friday), and the filament that came with it totaled up to $98 in savings. However, the P1S is on backorder, so I don't know when it will actually ship. The AMS is already in transit though. Today in science there was a quiz on parts of the skeleton. I'm 95% sure I got an 100. Also, I have attempted to do some backend using Google Firebase, but it just refuses to work (hence the comments section below). I also rolled out update 1.24 over the weekend. Some pages still need a bit of formatting after 1.24.

                    Today I played the first Gimkit game with Jayson in 145 days. It was really fun. I think I've decided my 8th grade quote. Vince also gave us a dodgeball game during 4th period.

                    There was no school today, so I worked on this website quite a bit. Now I'm on track to complete update 1.24 on 11/15. I also tried learning to use the CNC machine, and it's pretty complicated. I got an 100 on the Scott essay. We also only get 1 PE day this week. I'm currently trying to think of an 8th-grade quote for the yearbook. Two potential ones (that are very different) are: "I don't know" -Mike Johnson, and "You don't realize something was important to you until it's gone."

                    Today I got my second monitor working on my RPi 4. Turns out, the HDMI cable was bad. I now use the second display for coding and the first for everything else. I have tomorrow off, so I'm going to try to learn to use the CNC machine and update this website. I also just found out that my robotics team spent $200+ on lunch yesterday when we could've just spent $20. They also want to laser cut the metal drivetrain parts without CNCing wood for prototyping first. They're such money wasters, and half the parents don't even contribute money to the team. Tomorrow I'll also maybe call Jayson and Neel. Brendan still hasn't given me his Skype (now Teams, 🖕 Microsoft). I'll also CAD a v3 or v2+ robot and learn CAM.

                    The robotics competition was good. We currently have 1st place in our interleague because on the last match, we got really lucky and scored a 'motif' during auto, and we got 6 ranking points, pushing us up to first from fourth. I also upgraded my Pi setup to use two monitors but one of them doesn't work.

                    Tomorrow I have a robotics competition in Snoqualmie. Today we were doing some sort of outreach event and I borrowed a CNC machine from a friend in Olympia. I still need to learn how to use it. I'm also not sure that I can roll out the dark mode and settings menu before 11/15 because I'm so busy this time of the year. I also haven't read the entire Hiroshima book yet. I need to wake early tomorrow and it's 11:33 PM right now. On Friday in U.S. History, Scott apparently was teaching WA politics and Bob Fergusen and Dave Reichert and he joked, "It's a good thing that Caden and Brendan aren't in here".

                    Lua gave more time during the test today, and I got an 100% on Big Ideas. I might have lost a couple of points on showing work, since my compass line was very faint. I got an 100% in the most recent (double-sided) reading guide. Wayne got 1.5 off on the second question but Vince was so lazy to calculate the score that he just gave Wayne a 10/10. In Scott's class, I have a summative assessment on Monday, which means I have a 90% chance of losing my 99 in Social Studies. It's on this book called Hiroshima by John Hersey. In science, we also have a short project and the due date is TBD. I've also completely made the switch to editing this site on VS Code on my RPi 4B. Cloudflare hosting is actually really good compared to W3spaces.

                    In Geometry, there was a test that Lua said was "very short" but at the end of the period, half the people weren't done, and she says she probably will just have to grade what we have. So, half the class is extremely pissed at her (especially Julia, who was crashing out the rest of the day) and Wayne said he'll strangle her the next chance he gets. I'm really pissed too because I was part of the group that didn't finish. I really hope she gives extra time tomorrow. Also, we didn't have to play basketball today.

                    I somehow destroyed my off-brand RPi Camera. While I was testing the camera feed, the camera ribbon came off and when I reconnected it, something shorted, but I still don't know what. Now the camera module doesn't work on either of my Pis. Also, today in English I got my grade back after Vince entered it wrong last week. In PE, Vince left to go take a s** session and some fentanyl, so Lyle was subbing and we played Capture the Flag. Tomorrow we have to play basketball because stupid Appoline wanted to. I hate Vince's "basketball" because its just a long game of bump where everyone shoots once, and then this stupid 'poison' thing. I think that Appoline likes it because she/he/they (I don't even know) can just sit on the side most of the period.

                    Not much happened today. As usual, Vince took his biweekly absence, and gave us a DOUBLE-SIDED reading guide, while the second-period class gets to do IXLs. I think he took too much fentanyl the day before. Yesterday, I added a mobile-friendly menu, if you haven't noticed already, but I can't quite seem to get the settings page working. Brendan also finally won his first Gimkit game in about a week. By the way, yesterday was also Daylight Savings Day, which sucks because it messes up my sleep cycle and is essentially pointless. Plus, it just makes converting between time zones more difficult because some countries use DST and some don't. Also, yesterday I was on a call with Jayson and Neel, which was really fun. I wish that I could talk to them more often or even in person, but unfortunately thats impossible to do right now 😢.

                  Today in English, we watched a Twilight Zone episode where an insane dude sees a weird labubu destroying a plane but only he can see it. The episode is called 'Nightmare at 20,000 Feet'. As a plane nerd, obviously I notice a couple of problems. First, it was filmed in a non-pressurized-type airframe, which can't fly at 20,000 ft. Second, the labubu person somehow didn't get flung off when he was standing vertical on a wing in the middle of a storm, and theres a few more that aren't as big. Also, when I went to raid peoples' candy, the Seattle weather completely soaked me. Also, I didn't have a costume so I just taped an image of Pete Hegseth on my face.

                  Honestly, I'm not sure how my school is #1 in Washington state. First, it was that half the class didn't know which direction the sun rises. Then, Appoline and Anelia didn't know what a rhombus was, even though Lua warned them that a past student also didn't know the shape from the first-grade curriculum. Then, yesterday, Viyan didn't know the difference between beer, red wine and white wine. Rohit also asked if someone can be addicted to port wine (which is how Vince went on the ramble on addictions). Then today, Anelia said that you can only see the moon when it crosses in front of the sun. Olivia says the sun just appears because of the day and disappears at night. Also, Viyan doesn't know the definition of 'latter', and he keeps trying to steal my food. Also, if you have any new feature recommendations, please email me.

                    Today in English, Vince yapped for so long about types of wine and wine addictions and drug addictions (he's such a hypocrite).

Raymond also hit the ball straight up into the air nine times in a row and he kept getting foul balls.

                    I got around a 93% on the science test because I mixed up incomplete dominance and codominance. I also did a lot of editing to this website, which included adding two extra pages and a slight tweak in the menu UI. Mobile-friendly menus will come in the near future. I created an archive page for my blog posts over three months old so that this page doesn't get too cluttered, and I added a changelog/version history page with descriptions for each update. By the way, I have decided to not move this website back to w3spaces, so it should be here to stay until I decide otherwise. Also, I'm not dressing up for Halloween; I'm just gonna go raid peoples' candy. I've recently gotten an interest into optical disks (DVD, CD, Blu-ray, etc.), electro-mechanical disks (HDD), and similar disk-based storage methods. Also, in the lossless vs. lossy audio compression thing, I personally prefer lossy (mp3), since it is a much smaller file and there is no noticable difference between the compressed and uncompressed files. Additionally, mp3 is also the mainstream audio file compression format and is widely supported. Also, I have an SAT exam scheduled on December 6th, so I have to start practicing. For AP, testing doesn't happen until around May, so I have more time with that.
