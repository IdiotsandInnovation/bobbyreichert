                  Today in English, we watched a Twilight Zone episode where an insane dude sees a weird labubu destroying a plane but only he can see it. The episode is called 'Nightmare at 20,000 Feet'. As a plane nerd, obviously I notice a couple of problems. First, it was filmed in a non-pressurized-type airframe, which can't fly at 20,000 ft. Second, the labubu person somehow didn't get flung off when he was standing vertical on a wing in the middle of a storm, and theres a few more that aren't as big. Also, when I went to raid peoples' candy, the Seattle weather completely soaked me. Also, I didn't have a costume so I just taped an image of Pete Hegseth on my face. (Note: I know this entry says its October 31st, technically I'm writing this on November 1st cuz its 12:27 AM rn)

                  Honestly, I'm not sure how my school is #1 in Washington state. First, it was that half the class didn't know which direction the sun rises. Then, Appoline and Anelia didn't know what a rhombus was, even though Lua warned them that a past student also didn't know the shape from the first-grade curriculum. Then, yesterday, Viyan didn't know the difference between beer, red wine and white wine. Rohit also asked if someone can be addicted to port wine (which is how Vince went on the ramble on addictions). Then today, Anelia said that you can only see the moon when it crosses in front of the sun. Olivia says the sun just appears because of the day and disappears at night. Also,Viyan doesn't know the definition of 'latter', and he keeps trying to steal my food. Also, if you have any new feature recommendations, please email me.

                    Today in English, Vince yapped for so long about types of wine and wine addictions and drug addictions (he's such a hipocrit). Speaking of him, today he was a total of ten minutes late to class. In tennis baseball, I got three people out while I was at first base. Raymond also hit the ball straight up into the air nine times in a row and he kept getting foul balls. I decided to add a comments section to this page, but I then removed it shortly after because the Firestore dynamic content box wouldn't load. Also, if you haven't noticed already, I tweaked the format for this page a bit.

                    I got around a 93% on the science test because I mixed up incomplete dominance and codominance. I also did a lot of editing to this website, which included adding two extra pages and a slight tweak in the menu UI. Mobile-friendly menus will come in the near future. I created an archive page for my blog posts over three months old so that this page doesn't get too cluttered, and I added a changelog/version history page with descriptions for each update. By the way, I have decided to not move this website back to w3spaces, so it should be here to stay until I decide otherwise. Also, I'm not dressing up for Halloween; I'm just gonna go raid peoples' candy. I've recently gotten an interest into optical disks (DVD, CD, Blu-ray, etc.), electro-mechanical disks (HDD), and similar disk-based storage methods. Also, in the lossless vs. lossy audio compression thing, I personally prefer lossy (mp3), since it is a much smaller file and there is no noticable difference between the compressed and uncompressed files. Additionally, mp3 is also the mainstream audio file compression format and is widely supported. Also, I have an SAT exam scheduled on December 6th, so I have to start practicing. For AP, testing doesn't happen until around May, so I have more time with that.

                    I moved the website to this webpage today since cookies weren't working on the previous platform. I might move the website back and I'm still learning to use the Cloudflare platform. I have a science test tomorrow and I have to review 64 terms. Vince yelled at Brendan during dodgeball on Friday because the ball bounced off a wall, Brendan blocked it, and Vince claimed it hit his chest.

                    Today I created this website. It's kinda depressing here. Also the first time I touched HTML in around three years. I'm also really busy this semester so I don't know when the next time I post will be. I'll make this website more mobile-friendly in the near future. I also have a science test on Monday and a reading guide with five questions due on Tuesday. My FTC team isn't doing too well and I still need to practice for ACSL, SATs, and USACO.
